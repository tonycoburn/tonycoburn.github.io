I am originally from San Jose, California. I obtained my B.S. in psychology from [San Jose State University](http://www.sjsu.edu/) in 2011 and my Ph. D. in quantitative psychology from the [University of California, Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu/) in 2018, working with my advisor, [Dr. Jack L. Vevea](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/jvevea/).

As of Fall 2021, I am a lecturer in the [Department of Statistics and Applied Probability (PSTAT)](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/) at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/). My office is in South Hall Room 2431C, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106.

<!-- In July 2019, I was hired as a postdoctoral fellow working with the [STEPP (Statistics for Evidence-Based Policy and Practice) Center](https://stepp.center/) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). I work with Drs. [Beth Tipton](https://twitter.com/stats_tipton) and [Larry Hedges](https://www.statistics.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/larry-hedges.html). My office is in Room 201, 617 Library Place, Evanston, IL, 60208. -->

I have considerable experience both using and teaching R and have published an R package; see [weightr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/weightr/index.html) (Coburn & Vevea, 2015) and the corresponding [Shiny application](https://vevealab.shinyapps.io/WeightFunctionModel/). I also have considerable experience with GitHub and Python. I typically teach courses related to machine learning and data science, and also teach/supervise a senior capstone course.

I am passionate about pedagogy and have over 9 years of teaching experience; for more information, see [the related page](https://tonycoburn.github.io/teaching/).
